            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project!</h1>
            <p>This is my first project of many more to come in the future. For this Project, we were paired up into duos, and had to create a webpage for a fictional movie that we decide on using the HTML, and CSS that we had been learning.</p>
            <p>My partner is named Jaeson Kwan, and both him and I had decided to base our fictional movie on the Action-Horror Genre, with the movie eventually being called "Cursed Symphonies".</p>
            <p>Honestly, I feel very proud with the end result of my project! however, I must admit I struggled hard while using the span tag. I knew it would function similarly to the div tag, but I had trouble thinking about where it would go in our code. I tried to consider any additional ways I could use it, however I initally had nothing. How would I be able to work it into code? I remember thinking, until I had an idea. Since it's an inline code, what would happen if I link it into a list tag? Since then, I started experimenting, linking the two tags together, in an attempt to design a nice piece of text for one portion of the webpage. However when I tried to use the span in CSS, it.. Didn't work? Even more strange. I kept trying different methods, trying to see if my original plan worked. After some trial and effort by myself however, I did have to call for assistance from a few people, mainly from my partner for the project, and eventually, our teacher. After a short while, we started to notice something. As soon as the order between the lists and the span was changed in the CSS, the code worked! I was a little confused, but realized something: For this kind of code, the order does in fact matter, since they're both tags that were featured on the same sequence. I remember seeing this apply to classes, ids and inline codes, but this is also rather close. Regardless, I'm now going to be extra cautious about the order I put my CSS in.</p>
