            <p>This is my 2nd Ever Project, and Hopefully it's better than the last!</p>
            <p>But as the Title says, the Project was all about creating your own Choose you Own Adventure Game, though with the help of GitHub, and of course, our newly recieved IDEs.</p>
            <p>For this Project, I was paired up with a woman named Selena Gonzalez, and we agreed on making our Choose your Own Adventure based on Dimensions, and being able to transfer one's body through them. To do this, participants will first be given the option of entering 2 Unique Portals; 1 would lead to more calm paths and Dimensions, while the other is more Adventurous and to an extent Deadly. Then based off of your selection, you simply tried not to get a bad ending, using logical deduction and subtle clues left in messages. Overall, it was a really fun project to create!</p>
            <p>Admittedly however, I noticed that this Project was made to target some of the more recent things we learned in class, such as usage of our IDEs, and of course Merges, and how to handle them. Throughout the creation of the Project, I admittedly faced a lot of Challenges, whether it was making sure that everything wasn't deleted due to a Merge Conflict, or Simply having too many ideas for the project, causing me to repeatedly go back and forth editing bits of information. It's even why I added additional text to my Project efforts or entirely new parts, albeit with the consent of my partner. Regardless though, this Project definitely helped my creative mind go wild, whether in the story plot, or with the solutions to the Merge Conflicts that would show up. To Counter-Act the inevitable Merge Conflicts, me and my partner would solely focus on our own parts of the Project, saving the parts where we'd have to code together for last. Then, we'd carefully work on adding in things such as the Introduction to the Project, as well as the map of paths that can be taken. (Which is right below this actually) Regardless, we used coordination, patience, and teamwork to get through the entire project, which likely was another part that Mr. Mueller wanted to have us focus on, so it's another win!</p>
