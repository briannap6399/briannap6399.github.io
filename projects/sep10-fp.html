           <p>This project definitely has to be the most important project out of all of the ones I've worked on throughout the 10th Grade. I was not only challenged to review everything I've learned throughout the course, I also had to use information that I had generated and bring it all together for one informative website, coupled with at least one future innovation that can help further progress the topic we chose to make our website on. As a child, and especially now, I've realized how much of a passion I have for Writing, so my website is based all about Writing! But anyways, I wanted to try and make my website tie into how crucial Writing is for our languages, and why Teenagers like myself should be further motivated into Writing more, regardless of the topic.</p>
           <p>While the creation of what are known as 'Wireframes' were quite easy, the harder parts about this project comes from the actual development of the website. I admittedly struggled immensely on making everything look organized and neat, mainly due to how complex the Bootstrap Grid System was for me. No matter my efforts, I still remained stuck, with no exact idea how I could progress any further. I thought I was in danger, but that's when I got introduced to what I call the <em>'Carousel Strand'.</em> Because of what was honestly just 3 strands of code, as well as some additional internal motivation, not only was I able to bypass what I was struggling on, but I was also able to complete my website's skeleton within a day. While it isn't perfect, it's a great first attempt, and I honestly adore how it came out. The biggest takeaway I want to apply to this is to consider how small bits of information, which in my case for example was the Carousel Strand, can have massive impacts, bigger than one would expect. Regardless of how you see it though, my next steps overall is to improve on the Grid System, and prepare in advance for SEP 11, which from what I've heard targets Javascript.</p>
